# Instagram Archiver
Archive all posts with captions from a account. This service can be run on schedule to archive new posts as well.

## Run Locally
This project uses `pipenv` to manage dependencies. The script has been tested on python 3.6.
```
> pipenv install
> pipenv shell
> python insta-archiver.py
```

Before running the script you should rename the `env.sample` to `.env` and then update the values as per your environment.
